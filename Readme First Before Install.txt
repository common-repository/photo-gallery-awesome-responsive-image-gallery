### READ ME FIRST: Some users gave us 1 star rating because they can't find admin panel after activating this plugin. But documentation and video are given in this page and said everything where is the admin panel and how to work



### ADMIN PANEL: After active our plugin Go to Page > Add New. Click on "Add Media" then you can see media uploader. Now click on "Create Gallery" then upload some photos there then publish. Click "view page" then you can see an awesome image gallery :) 

When we got bad rating for misunderstanding then we decide we will remove our plugin. For This we removed the plugin from plugin folder but the plugin still have on wordpress plugin directory. That the time many users downloading the plugin. When users try to install the plugin their website they have to see the plugin is unpacking. After that some users gave bad rating and reviews the plugin. Then we contacted support and told them for removing our plugin but they reply us "if you remove your plugin from plugin directory it will be remove for forever".
